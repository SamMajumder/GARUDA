- **Interactive Visualizations**: Utilizes advanced data visualization techniques to present the similarity and differences between the user's song and playlist songs.

### Genre Analysis Tool
- **Genre-Based Search**: Allows users to input a genre keyword to fetch related tracks from Spotify, enhancing the scope of comparison.
- **Detailed Search Options**: Users can specify artist, album, and track details to refine their search.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compares the audio features of the user's specified song with those from the genre-based search results.

## How It Works

4. **Visualization**: Displays results through interactive UMAP plots that map out the similarity landscape, making it easy to visualize the comparative analysis.

### Genre Analysis Tool
1. **Genre Keyword Input**: Users enter a genre keyword and specify the number of pages to fetch, initiating a genre-specific search.
2. **User Song Details**: Users provide details about an artist, album, and track for which they seek a comparison.
3. **Fetch and Compare**: Retrieves songs related to the specified genre and compares their Spotify audio features with the user's song, displaying the results in an interactive format.
